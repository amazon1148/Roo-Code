# Rebase Plan Update

## Context
- Currently on branch: **main**
- Remote branches available: **origin/main**, **origin/update-package-json-sync**, **upstream/main**

## Steps Overview
1. **Create `plan.md`:** Completed.
2. **Check for unstaged or uncommitted changes:** Completed (untracked files identified).
3. **Add `webview-ui/tsbuildinfo` to `.gitignore`:** Completed.
4. **Delete `webview-ui/tsbuildinfo`:** Completed.
5. **Identify the limited local changes:** Completed.
6. **Create a new branch for the isolated local changes:** Completed.
7. **Clean up duplicate branches:** Updated.
8. **Rebase `main` branch onto `upstream/main`:** Pending.
    - Command to execute:
      ```
      git checkout main
      git rebase upstream/main
      ```
    - If conflicts occur:
      - Run `git status` to identify conflicted files.
      - Edit the conflicted files using your preferred text editor (e.g., VS Code).
      - Stage the resolved files using `git add <conflicted_file>`
      - Continue the rebase with `git rebase --continue`
9. **Force push the rebased `main` branch to `origin`:** Pending (to be executed after a successful rebase).
    - Note: The 9 commits ahead of RooVetGit/Roo-Code:main will remain in your fork only and will not be pushed to the upstream repository.
    - Command:
      ```
      git push --force origin main
      ```
10. **Push the new branch containing the isolated local changes to `origin`:** Pending (ensure branch is checked out before pushing).
    - Commands:
      ```
      git checkout feature/local-changes
      git push origin feature/local-changes
      ```

## Execution Flow
1. Confirm that you are on the `main` branch.
2. Execute the rebase:
   ```
   git checkout main
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```
3. Resolve any conflicts if they arise by:
   - Checking conflicts with `git status`
   - Editing the conflicted files
   - Staging the resolved changes with `git add <file>`
   - Continuing the rebase with `git rebase --continue`
4. Once the rebase is complete, force push the updated `main` branch:
   ```
   git push --force origin main
   ```
   - Note: The extra commits from the fork will remain only on your fork and will not be pushed to upstream.
5. Finally, switch to the isolated branch and push it:
   ```
   git checkout feature/local-changes
   git push origin feature/local-changes
   ```

## Confirmation Needed
Please provide the outputs from these execution steps to fully complete the rebase plan.
